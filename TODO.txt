TODO:

- test pebble inheritance loading + inclusion
- test freemarker inclusion

- test on windows
- test on mac

- support a "documentation use case".
    - see http://www.mkdocs.org/
	- identify the best set of directives needed to simplify this use case
	- we want to generate something like http://docs.jboss.org/seam/3/latest/reference/en-US/html/
	  without too much effort.
	   
	- use file system layout, file name + dir name dictate the structure, depth can be used to define the cut out
	- index.html : 
	  ---
	  directive: 'include-all'
	  include-all: 'docs/**/*.'
	  recursive: true
	  toc-depth: 3
	  paginate-at-depth: 3
	  ---

- draft support

- archetype support (blog, doc, multi language standard website)


- refactor processing pipeline: add an additional stage. 
  Currently for each resource we output directly the result. Instead, it would be better to first generate
  a representation of the output tree, and then apply the processors.

- replace all syserr with java.util.logging : it's more sane if we want to use it as a lib...

- support
	- iterate-over-static-directory: a special case for paginate with a page size of 1 for static dir
		- page name is generated from the static file name
		- useful for generating gallery, where the user will paginate over the thumbnails (using a filter), and the iterate will generate the page containing the image

- check non thread safety of pegdown

- autoreload:
	- return list of changed files (for css only reload)

- override for in config file:
	- output dir
	- content
	- layout
	- static
	- locales
	
  they must be relative
  
- webserver:
	- instead of the no cache directive, add etag support


- cleanup:
	- LayoutBasePath.exist

- tests

- check and fix any inconsistencies created by the override-output-to-path property

- init command

- handle more common errors
- add help :D
- add documentation and examples 

- add a global view of the generated structure as a model parameter for the sitemap generation usecase

- for images, add metadata extraction support with iterate-over-static-directory (?) + thumbnail generation?:
